# Coding workflow preferences

— Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
— Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
— Write thorough tests for all major functionality
— Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
— Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be
affected by code changes
